# PoPo

> AI-powered MMD pose generator - Transform natural language into expressive 3D character animations

**PoPo** bridges natural language and 3D character animation. Describe any pose or expression in plain English‚Äîfrom simple gestures to complex emotional scenarios‚Äîand watch as AI translates your words into precise MMD character animations in real-time.

**Live demo: [popo.love](https://popo.love)**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Input**: "tired after work, stretching arms, but shy about friend's affair news"
- **Real-time Generation**: Instant pose creation with smooth bone animations
- **Advanced Character Control**: 20+ facial morphs + full skeletal manipulation
- **Professional Quality**: Quaternion-based rotations with MMD physics integration

## üéØ Why MMD-Specific?

**Generic pose-to-3D tools** generate abstract joint rotations for universal 3D models.

**PoPo focuses on MMD**: Direct bone/morph control using MMD's exact naming conventions and constraints. Perfect for MMD creators who need precise character animation without manual bone adjustment.

## üéØ Example Prompts

```
"look right with a shy smile"
"angry face while lifting left foot"
"exhausted after gym, wiping sweat, excited about results"
"nervous before presentation, fidgeting hands, looking down"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

- **Frontend**: Next.js, shadcn/ui, TypeScript
- **3D Engine**: Babylon.js with babylon-mmd
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Current: MMD-Specialized Prompts

Advanced prompt engineering converts natural language to precise MMD parameters:

- **MMD Bone Names**: Direct control of MMD skeleton (È¶ñ, È†≠, ‰∏äÂçäË∫´, Â∑¶ËÖï, Âè≥ËÖï, etc.)
- **Japanese Morphs**: Native MMD facial expressions (Âõ∞„Çã, „Å´„Åì„Çä, ÊÄí„Çä, ÁÖß„Çå, etc.)
- **Anatomical Constraints**: MMD-specific bone hierarchies and rotation limits
- **Context Understanding**: Complex emotional + physical state combinations

### Ongoing: MMD-Trained LLM

- **MMD Dataset**: Training on VMD/VPD files with natural language descriptions
- **Specialized Vocabulary**: Understanding MMD bone names and morph terminology
- **Output Consistency**: Reliable JSON format for direct MMD integration

## üé≠ Evolution from MiKaPo

PoPo builds on **[MiKaPo](https://mikapo.amyang.dev)** (MediaPipe real-time motion capture):

- **MiKaPo**: Camera ‚Üí MediaPipe pose landmarks ‚Üí MMD bones (real-time capture)
- **PoPo**: Text ‚Üí AI ‚Üí MMD bones (generative control)

Same proven 3D engine, new AI-driven input method.

# MMD Pose & Expression Text-to-Pose (gpt-4.1-mini)

## Purpose

This project is for generating MMD (MikuMikuDance) pose and facial expression JSON data directly from natural language descriptions, using a fine-tuned **gpt-4.1-mini** (GPT-4o-mini) model.

## Data Format

Each example consists of a natural language pose/scene description and the corresponding MMD JSON output. The format is:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You generate MMD pose and expression JSON from descriptions." },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Standing with both arms extended forward, palms open and fingers spread, as if gently pushing something away. The body leans slightly forward, left foot ahead of the right, with a confident yet gentle expression. The head is tilted slightly down, eyes focused ahead, lips softly pursed."
    },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "{ ...JSON pose data... }" }
  ]
}
```

- **System prompt:** Short and high-level.
- **User message:** Natural language pose/scene description.
- **Assistant message:** The expected MMD pose/morph JSON output.

## Best Practices for Data

- Use the model's left/right perspective (not the viewer's) in all descriptions.
- Explicitly mention finger positions and facial expressions for clarity.
- Omit zero/default values in output JSON to save tokens.
- Use diverse, high-quality examples covering a wide range of poses, gestures, and expressions.

## Example Use Case

- **Input:** "Standing with right arm raised high, left arm extended to the side, right hand forming a peace sign, eyes open and smiling."
- **Output:** JSON with all relevant MMD bone rotations, positions, and morph values for the described pose and expression.
